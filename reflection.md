# Reflection
Setting up my Django environment was both challenging and rewarding. At first, I had difficulties because PowerShell did not recognize Python and pip commands, which made it impossible to create or activate the virtual environment. I solved this by checking if Python was installed correctly and ensuring that it was added to the system PATH. Another challenge was activating the virtual environment in PowerShell. The system blocked the Activate.ps1 script due to security restrictions. I fixed this by changing the execution policy temporarily using the command Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass, which allowed me to activate my environment without permanently changing my system settings.

After successfully activating the environment, I was able to install Django and start a new project. I also faced issues with pushing my code to GitHub because the remote repository already had existing commits. I resolved this by pulling the changes first and then pushing my local files. These challenges helped me practice problem-solving and understand the importance of carefully reading error messages to find the correct solutions.
